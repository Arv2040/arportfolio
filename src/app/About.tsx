        Hey, I’m Arav — just a regular guy who loves building things and occasionally yelling at the TV during Manchester United matches. I enjoy trying out new ideas, whether it’s a tech stack or a random hobby. When something clicks, I give it my full focus and try to do it really well. I like to keep things simple, learn as I go, and improve bit by bit. The dream? To be the best at what I do — one bug fix, one goal celebration, and one late-night coding session at a time.
